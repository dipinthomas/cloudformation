Host Cloudformation scripts

Hi This repository will host cloudformation script for different usercases. And I will provide brief over here.

1) CF-Hosted-Zone-Creaton.json 
	Using this script you can create a private hosted zone on AWS. If you remove the VPC block from the script same can be used for public hosted zone.


2) CF-VPN.json
	Using this script you can create VPN for your VPC on aws to on-premises location.
